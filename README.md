# Guessing-Game
The project is an application complete with UI that asks users to guess a string selected at random from a 
list of strings stored in files\Names.txt. This file is required to be present in the said location. 
The application takes care of storing the name of the user and the score (incremented once each time the correct string is guessed).
Number of tries to guess is not limited.
